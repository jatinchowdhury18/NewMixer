# NewMixer

NewMixer is a non-traditional mixing tool, meant to break free of the typical "virtual mixing board" mixing tools present in most modern Digital Audio Workstations. Rather than representing audio tracks as channel strips on a hardware mixer, NewMixer visualizes tracks as sound sources in space. This visualization allows for more intuitive controls over basic mixing functions such as panning, reverberance, and gain, while also giving the user visual cues to help them achieve the width and depth they desire in their mix.
